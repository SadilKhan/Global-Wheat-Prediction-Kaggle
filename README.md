# Global-Wheat-Prediction-Kaggle

In this competition, Weâ€™ll detect wheat heads from outdoor images of wheat plants, including wheat datasets from around the globe. Using worldwide data, we will focus on a generalized solution to estimate the number and size of wheat heads. To better gauge the performance for unseen genotypes, environments, and observational conditions, the training dataset covers multiple regions. we will use more than 3,000 images from Europe (France, UK, Switzerland) and North America (Canada). The test data includes about 1,000 images from Australia, Japan, and China.

The data is images of wheat fields, with bounding boxes for each identified wheat head. Not all images include wheat heads / bounding boxes. The images were recorded in many locations around the world.


We are attempting to predict bounding boxes around each wheat head in images that have them. If there are no wheat heads, We will predict no bounding boxes.
